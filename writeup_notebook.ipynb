    "## Rubric Points\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",
    "* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",
    "* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network \n",
    "* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Submission includes functional code\n",
    "Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable\n",
    "\n",
    "The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model consists of a convolution neural network with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 8 and 64, a Flatten layer and three Dense layers (model.py lines 121-146).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also includes maxpooling layers to introduce nonlinearity (code lines 127, 131, ...), each Conv2D layer has a RELU activation for the same reason.\n",
    "The data is not being normalized inside the model itself, I use some external Python code both in the training script and the driving script instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains two dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 123, 138). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 173, 174). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 146).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road, and driving in the opposite direction (clockwise on the main track) \n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I have created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to use LeNet architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the classic LeNet, but with more Conv2D filters in each layer and of course only a single Dense output, predicting the steering angle as a continuous value (instead of 1-0 classification outputs). I decided this kind of model might to be appropriate because it worked well for various image processing tasks (as numbers recognition, road signs recognition and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model with adding a Dropout layer right after the first Conv-Maxpool chunk, and after the Flatten layer. I have seen such approach in some model architectures for image processing before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I ... \n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track, so, in order to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I collected a bit more data with recovery movements, and also added some more Dense neurons and Conv2D filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 121-145) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of left, center and right lane driving:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                     |                     |                     |\n",

    "|![alt text][image_lo]|![alt text][image_co]|![alt text][image_ro]|\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, however, I have decided to crop the images, selecting only the bottom part of the frame (as the top part does not contain any useful information). Also, knowing about the width of the cropped image would be much larger than its heght, I decided to shrink the cropped frame vertically - as not each horizontal pixel carries a valuable information, and thus can be dropped without significant loss of information. This way, the input shape of my model is not 320x160 pixels, but 160x90, where 160 is the horizontal 320 with each second pixel dropped, and vertical size is 90 which covers pixels starting from 60 to 150 in the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the cropped images, that are supposed to become training data, is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                     |                     |                     |\n",
    "|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|\n",
    "|![alt text][image_lt]|![alt text][image_ct]|![alt text][image_rt]|\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would help to increase amount of the training data. For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                     |                     |                     |\n",

    "|![alt text][image_lf]|![alt text][image_cf]|![alt text][image_rf]|\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Dropout layer after the first Conv-MaxPool chunk also introduces some visual noise, that is close to the salt-pepper noise, I haven't added any other noises to the training images. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have then also recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to recover from any offset of the road center. These images below show what a recovery starting position looks like (original image + cropped train samples):\n",
    "\n",
